        # For JavaScript/TypeScript, CodeQL can analyze without building
        # If you wish to specify custom queries, you can do so here or in a config file.
        # By default, queries listed here will override any specified in a config file.
        # Prefix the list here with "+" to use these queries and those in the config file.
        # Example: queries: security-extended,security-and-quality

    # For JavaScript/TypeScript projects, autobuild is not needed
    # CodeQL can analyze the source code directly without compilation
    # If you have a build process that affects the analysis, uncomment and customize below:
    # - name: Build project
    #   run: |
    #     npm ci
    #     npm run build
