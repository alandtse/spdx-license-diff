[![Actions Status](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-license-diff/workflows/semantic-release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-license-diff/actions)[![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

Diff selected text against SPDX licenses and find the best match. This extension creates a browser button in Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Opera to compare any selected text against the SPDX [License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

**âœ¨ Now supports Manifest V3** for enhanced security and performance in modern browsers with full cross-browser compatibility.

The SPDX License List is a list of commonly found licenses and exceptions used in free and open source and other collaborative software or documentation. The purpose of the SPDX License List is to enable easy and efficient identification of such licenses and exceptions in an SPDX document, in source files or elsewhere. The SPDX License List includes a standardized short identifier, full name, vetted license text including matching guidelines markup as appropriate, and a canonical permanent URL for each license and exception.

## Permissions

The extension requires access to SPDX.org to download the latest license data. When you first use the extension, you may be asked to grant permission to access SPDX.org. This is required for the extension to function properly.

### Granting Permissions

If you see a "Permission denied" error, please grant access to SPDX.org:

#### Chrome, Edge, Opera:
1. Go to your browser's Extensions page: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "SPDX License Diff" and click "Details"
3. Click "Site access" or "Permissions"
4. Allow access to `spdx.org`

**Note**: Due to browser security models, host permissions cannot be granted automatically. The extension will display helpful error messages with specific instructions for your browser when permissions are needed.
